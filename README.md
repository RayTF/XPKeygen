Windows XP Keygen (Based on TheMCHK/WindowsXPKg with proper instructions)

---
## INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES
First, install MinGW from [here](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/)
After that, install the mingw32-base-bin and mingw32-gcc-g++-bin base packages.
Then, add C:\MinGW\bin to PATH

After that, copy the OpenSSL includes and libraries from [this zip file](https://master.dl.sourceforge.net/project/gnuwin32/openssl/0.9.8h/openssl-0.9.8h-lib.zip?viasf=1) to C:\MinGW

## COMPILING

After that, clone this repo (Or Download ZIP and extract if you don't know shit about Git)

Then, just run the ``build-all.bat`` file on CMD and wait for the files


And Finally, Run the ``windowsxp.exe`` File with CMD

```
windowsxp.exe
```

The output should look like this:

```
PID: 4c4b4000
Hash: 00238742
Sig: 00896bbe 472e803b
Product Key: Y2H28-4K7FP-2GM2F-HK6KG-MFVMB
